# Dockerized-app

This is just a test to see how I can deploy a react/node type app with docker. I plan to do something like this with Kubernetes in the future. Hopefully this will serve as a good exercise and I'll learn enough to implement this in some already existing applications.

This is a good [reference](https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-java/blob/master/slides/service-discovery-oscon2017.pdf).
